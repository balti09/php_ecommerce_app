# CI/CD Pipeline for e-commerce App
This Project will take us through the setup of a CI-CD Pipeline for a PHP-MySQL based e-commerce application.  

I use various tools such as Git, Jenkins and Docker.  
The pipeline stages are :  
	&emsp;&emsp;-SCM CHEKOUT  
	&emsp;&emsp;-Run Docker Compose File  
	&emsp;&emsp;-PUSH image to Docker Hub
